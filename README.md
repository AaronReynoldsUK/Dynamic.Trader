## Dynamic Data Demo

This is a c# sample wpf project to help get started with Dynamic Data.

Source code for dynamic data at https://github.com/RolandPheasant/DynamicData 
and blog at http://dynamic-data.org/

A big thanks to these guys for their awesome oss projects

- Mahaps https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro
- Dragablz https://github.com/ButchersBoy/Dragablz

There are also some examples which show how to integrate with [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI)

The demo illustrates how a few lines of code can produce this:

Plus much more.

## Run the demo

- Press 'Download Zip', unpack and open
- Ensure Nuget Restore is enabled
- Set 'Trader.Client' as the startup project
- Press F5

The menu looks like this and as you can see there are links to the code behind which hopefully will get you up to speed in no time at all
