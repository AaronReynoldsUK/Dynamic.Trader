## Dynamic Data Demo

This is a c# sample wpf project to help get started with Dynamic Data.

Source code for dynamic data at https://github.com/RolandPheasant/DynamicData 
and blog at http://dynamic-data.org/

The UI looks good and behaves well thanks to 

- Mahaps https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro
- Dragablz https://github.com/ButchersBoy/Dragablz
- ReactiveUI https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI (at the moment only for 1 example but soon to be more)

The demo illustrates how a few lines of code can produce this

## Run the demo

- Press 'Download Zip', unpack and open
- Ensure Nuget Restore is enabled
- Set 'Trader.Client' as the startup project
- Press F5

The menu looks like this and as you can see there are links to the code behind which hopefully will get you up to speed in no time at all
