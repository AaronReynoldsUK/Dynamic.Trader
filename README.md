## Dynamic Data Demo

This is a c# sample wpf project to help get started with Dynamic Data.

Source code for dynamic data at https://github.com/RolandPheasant/DynamicData 
and blog at http://dynamicdataproject.wordpress.com

The UI looks good and behaves well thanks to 

- Mahaps https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro
- Dragablz https://github.com/ButchersBoy/Dragablz
- ReactiveUI https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI (at the moment only for 1 example but soon to be more)

The demo illustrates how a few lines of code can produce this
